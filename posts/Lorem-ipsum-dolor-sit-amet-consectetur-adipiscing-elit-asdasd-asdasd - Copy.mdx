I recently decided to redesign and revamp my site. I had a few main goals:

1. Easier content management for blog posts
1. Simplified, minimal design
1. Dark mode support

###### Simplified Design

ðŸ¤©ðŸ¤©ðŸ¤©ðŸ¤©ðŸ¤©ðŸ¤©ðŸ¤©ðŸ¤©ðŸ¤©ðŸ¤©

<FullWidthImage
    src="/demo.jpg"
    alt=""
/>

<CustomSizeImage
    src="/x.svg"
    alt=""
    width={24}
    height={24}
/>

Before this redesign, I hand-rolled all of my components using [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/). I was trying to maintain a consistent design,
so I'd extract shared values out into a theme.

```js
export const colors = {
accent: '#ff5252',background: '#0a6159',
  border: '#dcdcdc',
  grey: {
      100: '#F5F7FA',
      200: '#E4E7EB',
      300: '#CBD2D9',
      400: '#9AA5B1',
      500: '#7B8794',
      600: '#616E7C',
      700: '#52606D',
      800: '#3E4C59',
      900: '#323F4B',
      1000: '#1F2933'
  },
  light: '#606060',
  text: '#101010'
};

export const spacing = {
  extrasmall: '0.5em',
  small: '1em'
  normal: '1.5em',
  large: '2em',
  extralarge: '2.5em',
};
```

Front-end tooling has rapidly progressed, and projects like [styled-system](https://styled-system.com/) and [Theme UI](https://theme-ui.com/) make it easy
to create components that easily adhere to your design system.

My site isn't anything crazy â€“ mostly a few simple static pages and blog posts. While coding everything myself is a
fun learning experience, there are plenty of component libraries that contain everything necessary to achieve the
design I was aiming for. That's why I chose to adopt [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/) for my redesign.

-   It uses styled-system under the hood, allowing me to use style props
-   The theme is extendable, allowing me to change fonts and add icons easily
-   It includes a great set of accessible components out of the box
-   Works well with Next.js and supports dark mode

Here's a quick example of Chakra UI and styled-system. This is part of the source for
the newsletter subscription at the bottom of this post.

```js title="components/Subscribe.js"
<Box
    border="1px solid"
    borderColor="blue.200"
    bg="blue.50"
    borderRadius={4}
    padding={6}
    my={4}
>
    <Heading
        as="h5"
        size="lg"
        mb={2}
    >
        Subscribe to the newsletter
    </Heading>
    <Text>Get emails from me about web development, tech, and early access to new articles.</Text>
    <InputGroup
        size="md"
        mt={4}
    >
        <Input
            aria-label="Email for newsletter"
            placeholder="tim@apple.com"
            type="email"
        />
        <InputRightElement width="6.75rem">
            <Button
                fontWeight="bold"
                h="1.75rem"
                size="sm"
            >
                Subscribe
            </Button>
        </InputRightElement>
    </InputGroup>
</Box>
```
